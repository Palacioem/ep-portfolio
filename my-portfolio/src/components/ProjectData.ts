The project focused on learning how to work in a version-controlled team environment, manage branches, handle merge conflicts, and follow a collaborative development workflow. Through this experience, I deepened my understanding of backend and frontend integration, user authentication, and database-driven web apps. I also gained hands-on experience with RESTful API design, user interface development, and state management",
